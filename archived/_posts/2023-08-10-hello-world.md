_**EDIT 2024-04-21**: We switched again to Just The Docs theme with a fresh commit history at [`f116de44`][deploykit-revamp].
We'll be posting a update regarding that and more soon. Original text goes below._

Welcome to our revamped website! We're currently migrating some content from our old
website[^1] as we'll be switching up to Jekyll with the [Type on Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap)
theme behind the scenes. It might take some time before we migrate all content here for obvious reasons, including
burnout and stuff outside the usual open-source work here.
