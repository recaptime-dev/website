# Support our projects by donating to Recap Time Squad

Recap Time Squad is mostly self-funded by @ajhalili2006's school allowance and
we're currently relying on donations from you to keep things running. Consider
chipping in today to ensure that projects are being maintained and the people
behind it are supported.

Here in this page are the ways you can donate to our team. If you have questions,
visit the FAQs page and don't hesitate to email us at `sponsors@recaptime.dev`.

## Online

=== "HCB"

    [HCB](https://hackclub.com/hcb) is Hack Club's in-house fiscal sponsorship platform +
    program for its partnered organizations, mostly teenager-led. Since we're fiscally
    sponsored through their program, we mainly use it to manage our finances as a team,
    alongside issuing donating invoices and handling reimbursements.

    You can donate to our organization through the embedded donation form below. ([Click here if the frame is too small](https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/recaptime-dev)) Donations in the US are tax-deductible to the extent by the IRS guidelines, as long as it is not in exchange for services/gifts.

=== "Open Collective"

    > Open Collective is a platform where communities can collect and disburse money transparently, to sustain and grow their projects. ([from their docs site])

    While we use HCB as our main platform for our fundraising efforts with finanical transparency by enabling
    Transparency Mode, we still using Open Collective to make them organized as well as to track expenses and
    income outside the HCB platform.

    Our Open Collective page is at <https://opencollective.com/recaptime-dev> (and the internal organization
    for shared vendor data and centralized reporting on OC side aka clearinghouse can be found at
    <https://opencollective.com/recaptimedev-hcb>). Note that if you request refunds for donations via Open
    Collective per our refund policy, you may receive the funds minus Stripe fees (since we use our own
    Stripe account outside HCB) and our fiscal sponsor's within days after being processed.

=== "PayPal"

    The HCB team does not currently accept PayPal donations yet, although Andrei Jiroh
    may handle these through a dedicated PH merchant account for Recap Time Squad.
