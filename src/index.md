# Hi, we're Recap Time Squad!

We're an all-remote open-source organization in the Philippines, initially as
a home of @ajhalili2006's projects (not only open-source software) since 2018[^1].
We might be look like nothing happened here, but we're cooking things behind the
scenes right now.

    Support the projects we build, maintain and host, alongside the humans behind them.
    (We chose to be a non-profit through being fiscally sponsored via [HCB], Hack Club's
    [fiscal sponsorship] program, rather than spending thousands of Philippine pesos setting
    up a legal entity while our BDFL is at school.)
