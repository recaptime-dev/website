# `@recaptime-dev/website`

> **Came here from [High Seas] and looking for the `@recaptime-dev/squad` project repository?**
> It is in <https://github.com/recaptime-dev/squad>, currently serves as a meta repository
> for the crew and the single source of truth for our profile READMEs (but not for our
> team-wide meta issue tracker), similarly to [Hack Club's] and [Open Collective's].
